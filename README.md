# CV_Fitness

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to use pre-trained computer vision-based models to generate joint kinematics during a lifting workout. Then use a physics model to estimate the joint kinetics (muscle torque).

## Setup
To install the python environment for this project, use the following command:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

The pre-trained computer vision model can be installed from the Carneige Mellon University (CMU) page using one of the commands below:

- For Linux:

`./getModels.sh`

- For Windows:
